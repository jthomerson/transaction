# PHP Transaction Processing Demo

Transaction processing is a way of handling task by spliting the task into chunks that either succeed or fail as a single unit.

The main file to open is `index.php`. However the setup and execution of the demo is handled in `src/demo.php`. `src/demo-equivalent.php` is the same logic only without using transactional processing.
